ok i will tell you why i need that, in fact i careated a websocket server in my local machine using c++ o visual studio 2019, so this server will send json infos to the clieant, the client is a web vue js app, so i need to deploy me web app on the github, but i need to this websocket server that i created to connect on the host in order to open a port on this host, so my web app can receive and send infos from and to my server

I see, in that case, you may want to consider deploying your WebSocket server to a server that has a static IP address and is publicly accessible. This will allow your Vue.js web app to connect to the WebSocket server using a stable hostname or IP address, without having to rely on the IP address of your local machine.

There are many cloud providers that offer virtual private servers (VPS) that you can use to deploy your WebSocket server, such as DigitalOcean, Linode, or AWS. Once you have deployed your WebSocket server to a VPS, you can configure it to listen on a specific port and accept incoming connections from your Vue.js web app.

Alternatively, if you prefer to deploy your WebSocket server locally and still want to access it from your Vue.js web app deployed on GitHub Pages, you can use a reverse proxy service such as ngrok to create a secure tunnel to your local machine and expose your WebSocket server to the public internet. However, keep in mind that this approach may not be suitable for production use, as ngrok is a third-party service and may have limitations or security risks that you need to consider.


my choise was to use the ngrok tool
------------------------------------
When you deploy your WebSocket server locally, it is only accessible within your local network, which means that your Vue.js web app deployed on GitHub Pages cannot directly connect to it. To enable your web app to connect to your WebSocket server, you need to make your local server accessible from the public internet.

One way to achieve this is to use a reverse proxy service such as ngrok. Ngrok creates a secure tunnel from a public URL to a local port on your machine, which allows external traffic to be forwarded to your WebSocket server running on the local port.

Here's how you can use ngrok to expose your local WebSocket server:

Download and install ngrok from the official website: https://ngrok.com/download.

Start your WebSocket server on a local port, such as localhost:3000.

Start ngrok and create a secure tunnel to your local port by running the following command in your terminal (to listen on port 3000 for example, so let's sqy that the our local websocket server running on this port):

ngrok http 3000
This command will create a secure tunnel from a public URL provided by ngrok to your local port 3000.

Ngrok will provide you with a public URL that you can use to access your local server. This URL will look something like https://abcdefgh.ngrok.io. Use this URL in your Vue.js web app to connect to your WebSocket server.

Note that the URL provided by ngrok is temporary and will change every time you start ngrok. If you need a stable URL, you can sign up for a paid ngrok account, which will allow you to reserve a custom subdomain.

Keep in mind that while ngrok provides a convenient way to expose your local WebSocket server to the public internet, it is not designed for production use and may have limitations such as connection timeouts and data transfer limits. If you need a more robust solution, you may want to consider deploying your WebSocket server to a cloud provider such as AWS or DigitalOcean.
